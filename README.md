##Traveling Salesman Problem Visualization
Lets user place points on a canvas and generates a short Hamiltonian cycle
traversing those points.  User may choose between finding an exact solution or
an approximate solution. The number of points that the user may place if finding
the exact solution is severely limited because the traveling salesman problem is
NP-hard, and the calculation is sluggish beyond about 15 locations.

Click on the empty space to add or remove points.

###Keyboard shortcuts:
Press the space bar to calculate.

Press 'r' to reset.

Press 'p' to add a random point.

This code needs to be cleaned up.

Also, it would be interesting to implement a simulated annealing approximation
algorithm in the future.
